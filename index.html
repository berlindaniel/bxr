        This is the homepage for team BXR, a group of Undergrad CS students at Duke
        working with the early-stage startup for CS290 - Software Rapid Prototyping.
        This webpage will serve as a source to document our work and progress throughout
        the semester.

        <h1 class="welcome-text">A brief overview of BXR...</h1>
        <p>BXR is a company that connects AirBnb users to consumer products. Brands will advertise their
        products by letting AirBnb customers sample them in a home setting. Cutomers will leave detailed reviews
        on the products in exchange for some sort of reward (money, points). Brands will benefit from increased exposure
        and user testing information. Our goal is to provide BXR with a static website and QR code survey functionality
        for user reviews. Time-permitting, we could explore mobile design in iOS.</p>
